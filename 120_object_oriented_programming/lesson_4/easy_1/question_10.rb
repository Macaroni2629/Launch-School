# If we have the class below, what would you need to call to create a new instance of this class.
    
class Bag
  def initialize(color, material)
    @color = color
    @material = material
  end
end

# If you tried to create a new instance of the bag by calling Bag.new you would have received an error like the one below:

# ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (0 for 2)
#   from (irb):in `initialize'
#   from (irb):in `new'
  
# This is Ruby telling us that we are missing some arguments and this is totally correct.

# As you can see from the initialize method, it is expecting two arguments. So as long as we pass in two arguments this error will go away - for example we could call this with Bag.new("green", "paper") and because this is providing the arguments that are needed it will successfully create the instance without an error.
