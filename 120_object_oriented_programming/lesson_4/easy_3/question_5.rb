# If I have the following class:


class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

# What would happen if I called the methods like shown below?


tv = Television.new
tv.manufacturer
tv.model

Television.manufacturer
Television.model

# If you attempted to call tv.manufacturer you would get an error and it would look something like this undefined method manufacturer for #<Television:XXXX>, this is because tv is an instance of the class Television and manufacturer is a class method, meaning it can only be called on the class itself (in this case Television).

# You would also get an error if you tried to call Television.model, the error would look something like NoMethodError: undefined method 'model' for Television:Class. This is because this method only exists on an instance of the class Television in this case tv.
