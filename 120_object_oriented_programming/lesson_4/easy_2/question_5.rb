There are a number of variables listed below. What are the different types and how do you know which is which?
  
excited_dog = "excited dog"
@excited_dog = "excited dog"
@@excited_dog = "excited dog"
  
Here we have the following variables:

Local variable - excited_dog Instance variable - @excited_dog Class variable - @@excited_dog

We can tell which is which by how the variables are prefixed. Local variables do not contain anything prefixed, while instance variables are prefixed with the @ and class variables are prefixed with @@.
