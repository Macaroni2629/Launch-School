# If I have the following class:

class Television
  def self.manufacturer
    # method logic
  end

  def model
    # method logic
  end
end

# Which one of these is a class method (if any) and how do you know? How would you call a class method?

# Class methods in Ruby start with self so in this case the self.manufacturer method is the class method.

# You can call a class method by using the class name and then calling the method. For example here it would be Television.manufacturer.
