# Multiplicative Average
# Write a method that takes an Array of integers as input, multiplies all the numbers together, divides the result by the number of entries in the Array, and then prints the result rounded to 3 decimal places. Assume the array is non-empty.

# Examples:


def show_multiplicative_average(numbers)
  product = 1.to_f
  numbers.each { |number| product *= number }
  average = product / numbers.size
  puts "The result is #{format('%.3f', average)}"
end


p show_multiplicative_average([3, 5])                # => The result is 7.500
p show_multiplicative_average([6])                   # => The result is 6.000
p show_multiplicative_average([2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]) # => The result is 28361.667

# Discussion
# We could use Enumerable#inject to compute the product, but for simplicity, we use #each instead. Once we have the desired product, we calculate the multiplicative average and format it with three decimal places.

# Further Exploration
# What happens if you omit the call to #to_f on the first line of our method?
