What Century is That?
Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise the 20th century.

Examples:

p century(2000) == '20th'
p century(2001) == '21st'
p century(1965) == '20th'
p century(256) == '3rd'
p century(5) == '1st'
p century(10103) == '102nd'
p century(1052) == '11th'
p century(1127) == '12th'
p century(11201) == '113th'

def century(year)
  century = year / 100 + 1
  century -= 1 if year % 100 == 0
  century.to_s + century_suffix(century)
end

def century_suffix(century)
  return 'th' if [11, 12, 13].include?(century % 100)
  last_digit = century % 10

  case last_digit
  when 1 then 'st'
  when 2 then 'nd'
  when 3 then 'rd'
  else 'th'
  end
end

First, notice a pattern about a century. It is equal to the current year divided by 100 plus 1. The exception to this is if the year is some multiple of 100. In that case, the century is the current year divided by 100.

Next we need to understand which suffix to append for our century, the options being: 'th', 'nd', 'rd', 'st'. We decide which one to use by checking the last digit of the century. Though, before we do that, we do need to do one extra check. If the century's value mod 100 ends in either 11, 12, or 13, then we should return 'th'. Any other time, we can return a suffix determined by our case statement and the value of century % 10.

Finally, we combine the string representation of the century with the correct suffix, and we have our answer.

def century(year)
  cent = (year.to_f / 100).ceil.to_s

  if cent.end_with?("1") && !(cent.end_with?("11"))
    cent << "st"
  elsif cent.end_with?("2") && !(cent.end_with?("12"))
    cent << "nd"
  elsif cent.end_with?("3") && !(cent.end_with?("13"))
    cent << "rd"
  else
    cent << "th"
  end
end
